# World-Data-UI
A user-interactive model which utilizes multiple design patterns, API generated data, and data-visual display through charts, graphs, and viewers. The UI includes a proxy-design login system and the main UI is designed with a Factory Method design pattern. For the data, our team streamed API-generated data into the UI with whitelisted data for error-tracking, creating a functioning World Data UI which displays user-specified data through user selected viewers.
